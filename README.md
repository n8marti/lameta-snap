# laMETA snap package

This repository provides an UNOFFICIAL build of laMETA to Canonical's [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io).

Lameta is mainly aimed at collections made in the course of documenting language, music, and other cultural expressions.

Lameta greatly simplifies management of collections and makes the archiving process straightforward and painless for field workers.

```
If you get an error, it might be that you need to use sudo privileges:
